Drek's Plugin Pack

There are 2 Team Fortress 2 plugins included here.

mod_hld_tf.php   - This plugin is designed specifically for Team Fortress 2 servers with friendly fire enabled.  It removes hit location and damage stats from the stats but does not remove headshot kills.

mod_hldff_tf.php - This plugin is designed specifically for Team Fortress 2 servers without friendly fire enabled.  This plugin removes hit location, damage, and friendly fire kills from the stats but does not remove headshot kills.

Credit goes to Stormtrooper for providing me with the basic code.  I just modified it to suit my purposes.
